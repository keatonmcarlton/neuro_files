How to use:

Put all 16 Neuralynx Data files (.csc) files into 'data' folder

1. To simply view before/after, simply run CAR_runThisFirst. You will see how the data is affected by general Common Average Referencing
2. eventsArr_runThisSecond will generate event markers for when the program "finds" spikes from its algorithm
3. graphs_runThisThird will show graphs and statistics for the data from the 16 files
4. Ideally, running main does all 3 of these.
NOTE: to run one file, you must run them in order. Skipping files will not work
