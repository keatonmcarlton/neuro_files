How to use:

Download neuro_files as a ZIP file, unzip the file somewhere appropriate.

Put all 16 Neuralynx Data files (.csc) into 'data' folder (**MUST be 16**)

Simply run main.m, alternatively, 
1. To view before/after Common Average Referencing, simply run CAR_runThisFirst.
2. eventsArr_runThisSecond will generate event markers for when the program "finds" spikes from its algorithm
3. graphs_runThisThird will show graphs and statistics for the data from the 16 files
4. Ideally, running main does all 3 of these.

**Program creates a folder named 'generated_data.' 
All new images and .ncs files data will be placed into generated_data when complete, and is safe to delete**

NOTE: to run one file, you must run them in order. Skipping files will not work
